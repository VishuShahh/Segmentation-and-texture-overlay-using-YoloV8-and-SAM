Object Detection and Texture Manipulation README


This README provides an explanation of the code you've uploaded to GitHub, which is designed to perform the following tasks:
1. Detect a particular target object in an image provided by the user.
2. Create a segmentation mask for the detected object using Self-Attention Masks (SAM).
3. Manipulate the arrays masked for that object to switch the texture using a texture image uploaded by the user.
4. The code utilizes various libraries and techniques to achieve these tasks. Below is a breakdown of each section:


Environment Setup:
Before running the code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can check the PyTorch and Torchvision versions and the availability of CUDA (GPU support) using the provided commands. Additionally, install the necessary packages for OpenCV, Matplotlib, and the SAM library:

!{sys.executable} -m pip install opencv-python matplotlib
!{sys.executable} -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git'

The code also downloads sample images and a pre-trained SAM model checkpoint for later use.


Object Detection:
The code starts by loading an image (e.g., sink.jpeg) and using YOLOv8 to perform object detection. The detected object (e.g., "sink") is saved in the runs/detect/predict5 directory. The results include bounding box coordinates, labels, and probabilities.


SAM Mask Generation:
The Self-Attention Masks (SAM) library is used to generate segmentation masks for the detected object. The code loads the SAM model checkpoint and creates masks for the object in the image. It then applies the masks to create a binary mask and uses it to extract the object from the original image.


Texture Manipulation:
The code provides two methods for texture manipulation:

1. Replacing with a Solid Color Background: This method replaces the background of the extracted object with a solid color (white). The result is an image with the object on a white background.
2. Replacing with a Texture Image: This method replaces the background of the extracted object with a texture image provided by the user. The replacement image is resized to match the dimensions of the binary mask, and the object is replaced with the texture.


Usage:
To use this code for object detection and texture manipulation:

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed as mentioned in the "Environment Setup" section.
2. Customize the input image (e.g., sink.jpeg) and specify the target object label (e.g., "sink") in the code.
3. Run the code to perform object detection and generate segmentation masks.
4. Choose the texture manipulation method you prefer:
5. Replace with a solid color background (white).
6. Replace with a texture image of your choice.
7. The manipulated image will be displayed using Matplotlib.
8. You can also access the results, including bounding boxes and masks, to further process or analyze the output.# Segmentation-and-texture-overlay-using-YoloV8-and-SAM
